# UNH Robotics Real Time Search Project


## Roadmap

* Implement BFS, Greedy & A*
    * Create ClosedList searcher
    * Create BFS of of that
    * Create Heuristic searchers
    * Create Uniform, Greedy & A* of of that
* Figure out what else is necessary for basic extension to:
    - Other domains
    - Other search algorithms
    - RealTimeSearch
* Implement other algorithms & other domains
    - RTS
    - aWA*
    - Sliding Puzzle

## TODO

* Figure out experiment framework
    * How to store/write results
    * What parameters are interesting
    * How to print/log paths (if any?)
* Figure out how to do the logging >> conventions

## Conventions

* iAmGoodVariable
* IAmGoodClass
* iAmGoodFunction()
* Braces open on same line
* No abbreviations
* Use Javadoc everywhere, but mind the verbosity

## Questions
 
* How to configure logging
