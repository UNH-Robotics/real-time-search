# UNH Robotics Real Time Search Project


## Roadmap

* Implement VacuumWorld
* Write classical experiment class
* Write a basic main, where DFS is tested in vacuumworld
* Figure out what else is necessary for basic extension to:
    - Other domains
    - Other search algorithms
    - RealTimeSearch
* Implement other algorithms & other domains
    - RTS
    - aWA*
    - Sliding Puzzle

## Conventions

* iAmGoodVariable
* IAmGoodClass
* iAmGoodFunction()
* Braces open on same line
* No abbreviations

## Questions

1. Markdown in intellij -- how?
